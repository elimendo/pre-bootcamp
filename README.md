# <PreBootcamp>

## Description

 I got familiar with Java's foundations, practiced with CSS, navigated Git's power, and used HTML's web structure. Hands-on exercises, and a structured approach. This familiarized me with technical skills but also instilled a new mindset for the journey ahead. 

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

## Usage

The Pre-Work Coding Guide is a great first step for green coders. The pre work study guide introduces HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It brings using JavaScript into the light and glosses over basic commands like functions and loops. Each section provides concise notes on key topics, making the learning experience both interactive and engaging. This guide isn't just informative, it's an invitation to your first step in your coding journey.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
